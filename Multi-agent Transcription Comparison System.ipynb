      "1. 3 ripe pears\n",
      "2. 1 1/2 cups of ricotta cheese\n",
      "3. 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour\n",
      "4. 3/4 cup of almond flour\n",
      "5. 1/4 cup of honey\n",
      "6. 3 large eggs\n",

      "8. 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract\n",
      "9. A pinch of salt\n",

      "Instructions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Preheat your oven to 180Â°C (350Â°F) and grease a 9-inch cake pan.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. In a bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt.\n",

      "3. In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, honey, and vanilla extract until smooth. Add the ricotta cheese and mix well.\n",

      "6. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Arrange the remaining pear slices on top of the batter.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Bake for about 40-50 minutes, or until the cake is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Let the cake cool before slicing. \n",
      "\n",
      "This dessert is relatively low in sugar, thanks to the natural sweetness of the pears and the use of honey as a sweetener. The whole wheat and almond flours add fiber, and the ricotta cheese provides protein and calcium. Enjoy it as a lighter finish to your meal!\n",
