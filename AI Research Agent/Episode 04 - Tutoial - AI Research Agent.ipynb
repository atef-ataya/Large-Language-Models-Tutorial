Only in the past few years has there been renewed interest\\nin the fundamental principles underlying this paradigm. In this paper, we\\npresent a rigorous comparative analysis of partial-order and total-order\\nplanning by focusing on two specific planners that can be directly compared. We\\nshow that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread\\nintuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning. For\\ninstance, the superiority of partial-order planning can depend critically upon\\nthe search strategy and the structure of the search space. Understanding the\\nunderlying assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners.', 'authors': ['S. Minton', 'J. Bresina', 'M.

We use two complementary approaches: (i) determining the initial density contrast and its evolution rate for a given collapse scale factor, (ii) computing the collapse scale factor for a specified initial density contrast and evolution rate. We derive analytical solutions for the growth rate $f=Ω_{\\\\rm m}^γ$ and growth index $γ$ in both models. Prior to the transition, the AdS-like $Λ$ reduces cosmic friction, causing linear matter density perturbations to grow more rapidly than in $Λ$CDM; this effect is most pronounced just before the transition, with a growth rate around $15\\\\%$ higher than $Λ$CDM around $z\\\\sim2$. After the transition, $Λ_{\\\\rm s}$CDM behaves similarly to $Λ$CDM but features a larger cosmological constant, leading to higher $H(z)$ and greater cosmic friction that more effectively suppresses growth. Before the transition, $γ$ remains below both the $Λ$CDM and EdS values ($γ\\\\approx6/11$); during the transition, it increases rapidly and then grows gradually, paralleling $Λ$CDM while remaining slightly higher in the post-transition era-though overall, it stays near $γ\\\\sim0.55$. Using the Planck best-fit values, $Ω_{\\\\rm m0}=0.28$ for $Λ_{\\\\mathrm{s}}$CDM and $Ω_{\\\\rm m0}=0.32$ for $Λ$CDM, we find $f=0.49$ and $f=0.53$, respectively. $Λ_{\\\\rm s}$CDM predicts a value of $f=0.48$, recently obtained from LSS data when $γ$ is treated as a free parameter in $Λ$CDM.

We use two complementary approaches: (i) determining the initial density contrast and its evolution rate for a given collapse scale factor, (ii) computing the collapse scale factor for a specified initial density contrast and evolution rate. We derive analytical solutions for the growth rate $f=\\\\Omega_{\\\\rm m}^\\\\gamma$ and growth index $\\\\gamma$ in both models. Prior to the transition, the AdS-like $\\\\Lambda$ reduces cosmic friction, causing linear matter density perturbations to grow more rapidly than in $\\\\Lambda$CDM; this effect is most pronounced just before the transition, with a growth rate around $15\\\\%$ higher than $\\\\Lambda$CDM around $z\\\\sim2$. After the transition, $\\\\Lambda_{\\\\rm s}$CDM behaves similarly to $\\\\Lambda$CDM but features a larger cosmological constant, leading to higher $H(z)$ and greater cosmic friction that more effectively suppresses growth. Before the transition, $\\\\gamma$ remains below both the $\\\\Lambda$CDM and EdS values ($\\\\gamma\\\\approx6/11$); during the transition, it increases rapidly and then grows gradually, paralleling $\\\\Lambda$CDM while remaining slightly higher in the post-transition era-though overall, it stays near $\\\\gamma\\\\sim0.55$. Using the Planck best-fit values, $\\\\Omega_{\\\\rm m0}=0.28$ for $\\\\Lambda_{\\\\mathrm{s}}$CDM and $\\\\Omega_{\\\\rm m0}=0.32$ for $\\\\Lambda$CDM, we find $f=0.49$ and $f=0.53$, respectively. $\\\\Lambda_{\\\\rm s}$CDM predicts a value of $f=0.48$, recently obtained from LSS data when $\\\\gamma$ is treated as a free parameter in $\\\\Lambda$CDM. This suggests that $\\\\Lambda_{\\\\rm s}$CDM may resolve the structure growth anomaly, without deviating from $\\\\gamma \\\\sim 0.55$.\\n    </blockquote>\\n\\n    <!--CONTEXT-->\\n    <div

      "We investigate linear matter density perturbations in the $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM, in which the $\\Lambda$ is replaced by late-time ($z\\sim2$) mirror AdS-dS transition, resulting in distinct growth dynamics. We use two complementary approaches: (i) determining the initial density contrast and its evolution rate for a given collapse scale factor, (ii) computing the collapse scale factor for a specified initial density contrast and evolution rate. We derive analytical solutions for the growth rate $f=\\Omega_{\\rm m}^\\gamma$ and growth index $\\gamma$ in both models. Prior to the transition, the AdS-like $\\Lambda$ reduces cosmic friction, causing linear matter density perturbations to grow more rapidly than in $\\Lambda$CDM; this effect is most pronounced just before the transition, with a growth rate around $15\\%$ higher than $\\Lambda$CDM around $z\\sim2$. After the transition, $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM behaves similarly to $\\Lambda$CDM but features a larger cosmological constant, leading to higher $H(z)$ and greater cosmic friction that more effectively suppresses growth. Before the transition, $\\gamma$ remains below both the $\\Lambda$CDM and EdS values ($\\gamma\\approx6/11$); during the transition, it increases rapidly and then grows gradually, paralleling $\\Lambda$CDM while remaining slightly higher in the post-transition era-though overall, it stays near $\\gamma\\sim0.55$. Using the Planck best-fit values, $\\Omega_{\\rm m0}=0.28$ for $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{s}}$CDM and $\\Omega_{\\rm m0}=0.32$ for $\\Lambda$CDM, we find $f=0.49$ and $f=0.53$, respectively. $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM predicts a value of $f=0.48$, recently obtained from LSS data when $\\gamma$ is treated as a free parameter in $\\Lambda$CDM. This suggests that $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM may resolve the structure growth anomaly, without deviating from $\\gamma \\sim 0.55$.\n"

Performed a web search to gather general information on LLMs.', 'main_body': 'Dynamic Backtracking is a variant of dependency-directed backtracking that optimizes the search process in constraint satisfaction problems. It allows backtrack points to be moved deeper into the search space, which can prevent the erasure of meaningful progress. This method is particularly useful in AI subfields such as planning, vision, and scheduling, where it can expand fewer nodes than traditional backtracking methods, thus improving efficiency.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of machine learning model designed for natural language processing tasks. These models, such as GPT-3, are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data and are capable of understanding and generating human language. LLMs utilize deep learning techniques, particularly transformers, to process and generate text, making them highly effective in applications like language translation, text summarization, and conversational agents. The ability of LLMs to handle complex language tasks has made them a cornerstone in the development of AI-driven language applications.', 'conclusion': 'Dynamic Backtracking and LLMs represent significant advancements in AI, each addressing different challenges within the field. While Dynamic Backtracking enhances the efficiency of solving constraint satisfaction problems, LLMs push the boundaries of what is possible in natural language processing.
