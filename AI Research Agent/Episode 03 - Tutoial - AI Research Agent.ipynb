Wrap-Up is a trainable IE\\ndiscourse component that makes intersentential inferences and identifies\\nlogical relations among information extracted from the text. Previous\\ncorpus-based approaches were limited to lower level processing such as\\npart-of-speech tagging, lexical disambiguation, and dictionary construction.\\nWrap-Up is fully trainable, and not only automatically decides what classifiers\\nare needed, but even derives the feature set for each classifier automatically.\\nPerformance equals that of a partially trainable discourse module requiring\\nmanual customization for each domain.', 'authors': ['S.

Well-known examples of graphical models\\ninclude Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and\\nundirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are\\nextended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of\\nplates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are\\nprovided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of\\nprobability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas\\nfor learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the\\nexpectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some\\npopular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This\\nincludes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks,\\nand learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper\\nconcludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how\\nsome popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original\\ncontributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that\\ngraphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex\\nlearning algorithms.', 'authors': ['W.

Only in the past few years has there been renewed interest\\nin the fundamental principles underlying this paradigm.

We\\nshow that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread\\nintuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning.
